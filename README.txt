The results show that the integral calculated by the Monte Carlo method is quite close to the analytical calculation.
With the number of points in 150 000 we have the following result:

Analytical integral: 2.66667
Monte Carlo integral: 2.67061

To enlarge the accuracy of the result let's increase the number of points to 1 500 000. And we observe the result is more accurate:

Analytical integral: 2.66667 
Monte Carlo integral: 2.66875

Thus, a larger number of points leads to more accurate results, but on the same time requires additional computation.
